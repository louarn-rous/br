## Adjectives

suffix "-oc'h" for the comparative  
suffix "-añ" for the superlative

these suffixes cause preceding consonants to undergo provection.

some verbs have irregular forms:  

| positive    | comparative                  | superlative              |
| :--         | :-                           | :-                       |
| bras (big)  | brasoc'h (bigger)            | brasañ (biggest)         |
| gleb (wet)  | glepoc'h (wetter)            | glepañ (wettest)         |
| ruz (red)   | rusoc'h (redder)             | rusañ (reddest)          |
| mat (good)  | gwell(oc'h) (better)         | gwellañ (best)           |
| drouk (bad) | droukoc'h, gwashoc'h (worse) | droukañ, gwashañ (worst) |

most regular equatives are formed with 'ken' (as):  
- ken gleb (as wet)  
- ken drouk (as bad)

some verbs can have seperate equative forms:  
- kement (as big)  
- koulz (as good)  
- ken gwazh (as bad)

exclamative suffix -at (obsolete except for certain expressions):  
- brasat (\[how] big!)   
- glepat (\[how] wet!)  
- gwellat (\[how] good!) 

diminutive form/suffix -ik :  
- bihan (small) -> bihanik  
- bras (big) -> brazik

## Adverbs  
adverbs do not inflect, and can be formed with 'ez:  
leal (loyal) -> ez' leal (loyally)

## Prepositions  
prepositions may or may not be inflected for person, number and gender.

|               | i endings   | o endings  |
| :-            | :-          | :-         |      
| (uninflected) | gant (with) | evit (for) |
| 1s  | ganin (with me)          | evidon (for me)          |
| 2s  | ganit (with you)         | evidout (for you)        |
| 3ms | gantañ (with him)        | evitañ (for him)         |
| 3fs | ganti (with her)         | eviti (for her)          |
| 1p  | ganimp (with us)         | evidomp (for us)         |
| 2p  | ganeoc'h (with you (pl)) | evidoc'h (for you (pl))  |
| 3p  | ganto, gante (with them) | evito, evite (for them)  |
| imp | ganeor (with one)        | evidor (for one)         |

some simple prepositions do not inflect:  
- eus & deus (from)  
- kent (before)  
- goude (after)

complex prepositions inflect by means of interfixes (the nominal 2nd element is preceded by a pronomial form).

| uninflected | diwar-ben (about) | e-kichen (near) |
| :-          | :-                | :-              |
| 1s  | diwar ma fenn (about me)        | em c'hichen (near me)     |
| 2s  | diwar da benn (about you)       | ez kichen (near you)      |
| 3ms | diwar e benn (about him)        | en e gichen (near him)    |
| 3fs | diwar he fenn (about her)       | en he c'hichen (near her) |
| 1p  | diwar hor penn (about us)       | en hor c'hichen (near us) |
| 2p  | diwar ho penn (about you (pl))  | evidoc'h (near you(pl))   |
| 3p  | diwar o fenn (about them)       | en o c'hichen (near them) |
| imp | diwar ar penn (about one)       | er c'hichen (near one)    |

## Conjunctions

certain conjunctions have an additional form when followed by a vowel:  
- 'ha' (and) -> 'hag'  
- 'na' (than) -> 'nag'

a conjunction is ususally followed by the particle 'e' when preceding a verb:  
- hag e kouezhas (and he fell)  
- peogwir e varvas (because he fell)

this is not the case for:  
- 'ma' (that, if)  
- 'mar' (if)  
- 'pa' (if, when, because)

## Pronouns

### Personal
Personal pronouns may be strong, post-clitic head or pre-clitic head.  
Strong pronouns have the same distruibution as a full noun phrase and may be subjects, objects or prepositional objects.  
Post-clitic head pronouns tend to follow finite verbs, nouns or inflected prepositions.  
Pre-clitic head pronouns function as object pronouns preceding verb phrases and possessive determinerss preceding noun phrases.

| prn | strong | pst-clitic | pre-clitic    | partitive paraphrase |
| :-  | :-     | :-         | :-            | :-                   |
| 1s  | me     | me         | ma, am ('m)   | ac'hanon             |
| 2s  | te     | te         | az' ('z'), da | ac'hanout            |
| 3ms | eñ     | eñ         | e             | anezhañ              |
| 3fs | hi     | hi         | he            | anezhi               |
| 1p  | ni     | ni         | hon, hol, hor | ac'hanomp            |
| 2p  | c'hwi  | hu, c'hwi  | ho, hoc'h     | ac'hanoc'h           |
| 3p  | int    | i, int     | o             | anezho               |

Like in French, the 2nd person plural is used as a 2nd person singular to show politeness.  
Alarge part of central Brittany has lost the 2s 'te' altogether and uses c'hwi for all 2nd person reference. The partitive paraphrase has replaced the traditional post-clitic obj pronouns in every dialect except Gwenedeg (Vannetais) except when obj is fronted for emphasis.  
The inflected forms of the preposition 'a' (of) placed after the verb are sub'd for the traditional obj pronoun, e.g 'E kêr e welas Yannig anezho' (Yanning saw them in town) more literally 'in the town Yanning saw of them' and occasionally function as subjectss (with intransitive, usually negative, verbs)

### Demonstrative

Demonstrative pronouns display 3 degrees of proximity, as well as gender and number.

|               | masc sg | fem sg   | common pl  |
| :-            | :-      | :-       | :-         |
| near speaker  | hemañ   | houmañ   | ar re-mañ  |
| near listener | hennezh | hounnezh | ar re-se   |
| far from both | henhont | hounhont | ar re-hont |

Demonstrative determiners are post-head clitics used in conjunction with the definite article.

|               | clitic                     | example                              |
| :-            | :-                         | :-                                   |
| near speaker  | -mañ (here)                | ar stêr-mañ (this river)             |
| near listener | -se (there)                | an ti bihan-se (that little house)   |
| far from both | -hont (over there, yonder) | al lent-hont (that lake over there)  |

### Indefinite

indefinite pronouns may be positive:  
- re (some, ones)
- holl (all)

and negative:  
- netra (nothing)  
- neblec'h (nowhere)

and may be preceded by a determiner:  
- an re (some ('the ones'))  
- da re (your ('your ones'))

## Verbs  
Breton verbs can be conjugated to show tense, impact, mood, person and num by adding suffixes to the verbal stem.

|     | indicative | indicative | indicative | conditional | conditional | conditional | imperative |
| :-  | :-  | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| prs | present | imperfect | preterite | future | present | imperfect |  |

| 2s  | -ez  | -es   | -jout  | -i   | -fes   | -jes   | _no ending_  |
| 3s  | _no ending_  | -e    | -as    | -o   | -fe    | -je    | -et  |
| 1p  | -omp | -emp  | -jomp  | -imp | -femp  | -jemp  | -omp |
| 2p  | -it  | -ec'h | -joc'h | -ot  | -fec'h | -jec'h | -it  |
| 3p  | -ont | -ent  | -jont  | -int | -fent  | -jent  | -ent |
